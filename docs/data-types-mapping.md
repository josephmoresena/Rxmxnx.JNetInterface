# Java Data Types Mapping

`Rxmxnx.JNetInterface` provides a structured mapping of Java data types through the `IDataType` interface, with
instances of `JDataTypeMetadata` used for identification.  
The following table illustrates how data type mapping works.

| Java Declaration                | Base Type                                   | Interface                               | Metadata                                                                                    | Inheritance                                             |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `class JavaClassName`           | `JLocalObject`<sup>1</sup>                  | `IClassType<NetClassName>`              | `JClassTypeMetadata<NetClassName> { ClassName = package/JavaClassName }`                    | `: NetClassName`<sup>2</sup>                            |
| `interface JavaInterfaceName`   | `JInterfaceObject<NetInterfaceClassName>`   | `IInterfaceType<NetInterfaceClassName>` | `JInterfaceTypeMetadata<NetInterfaceClassName> { ClassName = package/JavaInterfaceName }`   | `: IInterfaceObject<NetInterfaceClassName>`<sup>3</sup> |
| `enum JavaEnumName`             | `JEnumObject<NetEnumClassName>`             | `IEnumType<NetEnumClassName>`           | `JEnumTypeMetadata<NetEnumClassName> { ClassName = package/JavaEnumName }`                  | N/A                                                     |
| `@interface JavaAnnotationName` | `JAnnotationObject<NetAnnotationClassName>` | `IInterfaceType<NetInterfaceClassName>` | `JInterfaceTypeMetadata<NetAnnotationClassName> { ClassName = package/JavaAnnotationName }` | N/A<sup>4</sup>                                         |

1. The base type depends on the hierarchy of the mapped class.
2. To extend a class, the superclass must be defined when constructing the `TypeMetadataBuilder` instance.
3. To extend or implement interfaces, the corresponding interface type must be specified in the metadata. Implementing
   `IInterfaceObject<..>` enables covariance.
4. While Java annotations (`@interface`) are not meant to be inherited, they are treated as interfaces in the mapping,
   allowing inheritance.

## Specialized Types

| Specialization | Java Declaration                                        | Base Type          | Interface                                           | Metadata                                               | Inheritance                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Throwable**  | `class JavaThrowableName extends Throwable`<sup>2</sup> | `JThrowableObject` | `IThrowableType<NetThrowableClassName>`<sup>2</sup> | `JThrowableTypeMetadata<NetThrowableClassName>`        | `: NetThrowableClassName`<sup>2</sup> |
| **Primitive**  | N/A                                                     | N/A                | `IPrimitiveType<..>`                                | `JPrimitiveType<..> { ClassName = JavaPrimitiveName }` | N/A<sup>1</sup>                       |
| **Array**      | N/A                                                     | N/A                | `IArrayType<JArrayObject<..>>`                      | `JArrayTypeMetadata`                                   | N/A<sup>2</sup>                       |

1. Primitive types cannot be inherited, just like in Java. In CLR, they are value-type structures, and additional
   primitive types cannot be created.
2. Arrays, like in Java, are views. While inheritance is not allowed, the `IArrayObject<..>` interface enables
   covariance for class-type arrays. For example, a `JArrayObject<JStringObject>` instance can be assigned to a variable
   of type `IArrayObject<JLocalObject>` or `IArrayObject<IInterfaceObject<JSerializableObject>>`.

## Object Hierarchy

All JNI-interoperable types implement the `IObject` interface and extend or can be converted to `JObject`.

All JNI-interoperable objects are instances of `JObject`. Primitives undergo boxing when converted to `JObject`.

## Object Casting

Primitive type conversion in `Rxmxnx.JNetInterface` follows Java's promotion and truncation rules. To convert a
primitive type to its wrapper object, use the `.ToObject(IEnvironment)` extension method.

For `ILocalObject` instances, conversion to another type can be done using `.CastTo<TReference>()`.

Any `ILocalObject` instance can be cast to a `JLocalObject` type without any additional cost via
`.CastTo<JLocalObject>()`, as it returns the internal instance that represents the `ILocalObject`. For this reason, it's
usually not necessary to call `Dispose()` on the returned instance, since calling `Dispose()` on the `JLocalObject`
effectively discards the original `ILocalObject` instance as well.

When using `.CastTo<TObject>()` on an `ILocalObject` instance whose internal instance is not of non-view type
`TObject` (occurs when the `JNetInterface` hierarchy is not established or the type was not registered before the
instance was created), a new instance of `T` will be created, 'disconnected' from the original `ILocalObject`.
Otherwise, if the internal instance is already of type `TObject`, the returned `TObject` will be the same internal
instance.

For `JLocalObject` instances, use `.CastTo<TReference>(Boolean)`, where the boolean parameter determines whether the
original instance should be discarded when casting to a non-view type. When the `JLocalObject` instance is of a non-view
type `TReference`, even if it was indicated that the initial instance should be discarded, it will not be discarded, and
the same instance will be returned as the result of the cast.

When casting to a non-view type `TObject` results in a disconnected instance, `Dispose()` must be called explicitly on
that instance. Although both instances share the same local reference, it will only be released in JNI once both
instances have been disposed.

Since `JGlobal` and `JWeak` instances are not directly manipulable in most cases, the `AsLocal(IEnvironment, Boolean)`
method allows creating a functional local object within a given environment. The boolean parameter controls whether a
new local reference is created when performing the cast.

## Object Metadata

Each mapped type can hold cacheable instance metadata in `JNetInterface`, which is useful to avoid unnecessary JNI calls
when querying certain immutable properties after converting local objects to global or view representations. This
metadata must be an instance of the `ObjectMetadata` type.

This is enabled by implementing the `ILocalObject` interface and its protected methods `CreateMetadata()` and
`ProcessMetadata(ObjectMetadata)`. The implementation of these methods must follow a chain patternâ€”for example, when
creating metadata for the current mapped type, the metadata of the superclass must first be created as an instance of
its corresponding type. Similarly, when processing metadata, the method that handles the superclass's metadata must be
called first, followed by the current type's processing logic.
For this reason, metadata types must follow a hierarchy based on `ObjectMetadata`.

## Data Type Registration

One of `Rxmxnx.JNetInterface`'s key features is its ability to instantiate objects using the closest mapped and
registered CLR subclass for the actual instance class.

To register a data type, use the static method `JVirtualMachine.Register<T>()`.

##### Notes

- Registration occurs at runtime but is performed statically to avoid reflection and improve NativeAOT compatibility.
- When a non-array type is registered, its corresponding array type is also registered.
- Non-jagged array types do not require registration.
- Registering an array type also registers its element type. For jagged arrays, registration propagates to the
  fundamental element type.
- Primitive data types cannot be registered.
- Registering jagged array types is necessary if runtime reflection is unavailable or if
  `JNetInterface.DisableJaggedArrayAutoGeneration` is enabled.
- It is recommended to register data types before initializing `IVirtualMachine` instances, ideally
  within [module initializers](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/specs/Ecma-335-Augments.md#module-initializer).

### Main Types

Main types are mapped and registered types that are initialized with global references when an `IVirtualMachine`
instance is created. This ensures that any environment within the JVM can access them without restrictions. These global
references remain active until the JVM is terminated or explicitly removed from `Rxmxnx.JNetInterface`.
